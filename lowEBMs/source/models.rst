With this project different types of EBMs can be used to run simulations. 
However, the versatility of the resolution is limited to low dimensional EBMs from zero to one dimensionsal EBMs and additionally one dimensional EBMs that are resolved over the latitudes. It would be nice and is planned by me to extent this project to higher resolutions (for more information see :doc:`ToDo <todo>`)

The physical basis
==================

In general, Energybalance models describe the behaviour of a planet's energybudget over time (Here, the focus is obviously on the earth's energybudget, but EBMs can simulate the climate of other planets as well which is done by the PlaSIM_ model for example).

EBMs describe the energybalance mostly with the most crucial parts only, which means that small or strongly regional energyfluxes are neglected.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the earth's energybudget like it is often given in the standard literature. Indicated are the most important radiative energyfluxes of the earth
