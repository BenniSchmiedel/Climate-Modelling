How to use
**********

Here a brief introduction is given on how to get from a given input, which initializes the EBM you want to run, to an output, e.g. the global temperature propagation over time or the temperature distribution over a spatial grid representing the earth.

We will write a small python script, which will do this in a few steps. As it is easier to visualize the output in a plot and modify it, I recommend to perform this steps in a jupyter notebook.

The way the project is built up enables to take any physical function implemented here and merge them to create the basis of a desired EBM, which will be our input.
